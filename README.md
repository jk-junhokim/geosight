#### Image Similarity

We would like to acknowledge the google colab provided by [2].

Our similarity models are:
* DreamSim <sup>[2]</sup>
* DINO <sup>[3]</sup>
* CLIP <sup>[4]</sup>
* ViT <sup>[5]</sup>

ðŸ“Œ  Embed image features: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jk-junhokim/geosight/blob/main/img_sim/feature_embedding.ipynb)


ðŸ“Œ  Perform image retrieval: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jk-junhokim/geosight/blob/main/img_sim/image_retrieval.ipynb)
